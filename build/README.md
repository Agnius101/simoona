# Build

The contents of this folder is used to make building and starting Simoona easier. For this purposes we are using [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) with a combination of [Cake](https://cakebuild.net/).

## Required Software

1. NPM and Node.js (<https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm>)
2. Yeoman (<http://yeoman.io>)
3. Bower (<https://bower.io>)
4. SQL Server Express (<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-editions-express>)
5. IIS URL Rewrite (<https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite>)
6. Git (<https://git-scm.com/downloads>)
7. Visual Studio, or Microsoft Build Tools 2015 (<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48159>) and Windows 8.x SDK (<https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/sdk-archive>)

## Instructions

Build script has two main operations:

* **do everything**: creates the database for you using SQL scripts, inserts organization name and connection string to Web.config file, resolves API and WebApp dependencies, builds them and after some more steps launches Simoona.
* **create database and resolve dependencies**: just creates and inserts necessary data to database, modifies Web.config file then resolves project's dependencies. Use latter option if you want to build and launch Simoona using different commands or environments.

1. Run `build.bat` as Administrator and follow the "wizard".
2. Enter organization name (you will need to login to the app).
3. Enter default user e-mail address. You will use this e-mail address to sign-in. It will create a user with `testerPass123` as a password.
4. Enter database connection string (example: `Data Source=localhost\SQLEXPRESS;Integrated Security=True;Connect Timeout=60; MultipleActiveResultSets=True;`)
5. Enter dabase name (example: `SimoonaDB`)
6. Wait for build script to finish.
